\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* says, "After three atrocities from Gaza ---

\v 1 Listen to this problem,
\q2 that the \nd Lord\nd* has with you, people of Israel,
\q1 with the whole family
\q2 that I brought out of the land of Egypt:
\v 2 “You are the only ones I've had a relationship with
\q2 out of all the families on the earth.
\q1 That's why I'm holding you accountable
\q2 for all of your shortcomings."
\v 3 Are two people going to walk together

\v 6 When an alarm is trumpeted in a city,
\q2 won't everyone be agitated?
\q1 When disaster takes place in a city,
\q2 wasn't it brought on by the \nd Lord\nd*?
\v 7 Because His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* won't do a thing
\rem In the US "Your Honor" is the proper form of address for a magistrate. Everyone else is "mister," "sir," or nothing.
\rem Not sure of the best Continental equivalent. Your Excellency? My Lord Yahweh?

\v 8 A lion has roared. Will anyone not be afraid?
\q2 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* has spoken. Will anyone not speak out?
\v 9 Make an announcement from the high buildings of Ashdod,

\q2 \v 10 "It's that they have no conscience,
\q1 no sense of responsibility,"

\v 11 "So, then," says His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 An enemy will come and surround the land,
\q1 that will bring down your fortifications,
\q2 and your high buildings will be looted."
\v 12 This is what the \nd Lord\nd* says.
\q2 “Just as a shepherd recovers, from a lion's meal,
\q1 a couple of shanks or a piece of an ear,
\q2 so the descendants of Israel living in Samaria will be escape ---

\q2 You, there, on Samaria Hill.
\q1 Shouldering off the weak, scattering the needy,
\q2 calling to your husbands, “Bring out the drinks!”
\v 2 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* has sworn by his holiness:
\q2 "A time is coming for all of you
\q1 when you will be led along with hooks,
\q2 and chained to the one behind with fishhooks.
\v 3 You will go out in a line through the breaks in the wall,

\v 4 "Go to Beit El with your indiscretions.
\q2 At Gilgal, heap your scandals high;
\q1 And bring your sacrifices at first light.
\q2 Save your tithes till the third day!
\v 5 Then burn some leavened bread as a thank-offering,

\q2 says His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 6 "I was the one, though, that gave you

\v 7 "I was also the one who kept it from raining on you
\q2 with three months left before harvest.
\q1 And I let it rain on one city
\q2 At the same time as I did not let it rain on another.
\q1 Yet another region got some rain,
\q2 but a region that got no rain dried out.
\v 8 Then two or three cities
\q2 ranged as far as another city
\q1 for drinking water, and still they did not have enough.
\q2 And yet you didn't come back to me," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 9 "I plagued you with blight and mildew,

\v 11 "I brought disasters on you, acts of God.

\v 1 Listen to this problem,
\q2 that I need to take up with you.
\q1 It’s a sad song, family of Israel.
\q2 \v 2 “She has fallen, and she can’t get up. Miss Israel has.
\q1 Thrown down on her own ground,
\q2 with no one to help her to her feet.”
\v 3 Because this is what His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* says.
\q2 "A city that fielded a thousand has a hundred left,
\q1 and the one that fielded a hundred
\q2 has only ten for the House of Israel."
\v 4 Because here is what the \nd Lord\nd* says to the family of Israel:
\q2 "Learn from me and live.
\v 5 But don't start looking to Beit El,
\q2 and do not go to Gilgal.
\q1 And do not travel to Beersheba.
\q2 Because Gilgal is doomed to deportation,
\q1 and Beit El will become a ghost town."\f + \fq will become a ghost town. \fl Lit. \fqa will be (known as) Aven.\ft Beit El was destroyed without a trace. It is possible that Aven, "empty desire," was a nearby village.\f*

\q1 or he will rage like fire through the household of Joseph,
\q2 that burns, with no one to fight it, around Beit El.
\v 7 Where you’ve plowed under good judgment and grown [cth:wormwood|us:sagebrush],
\q2 and put a stop to right practices with bad laws.
\v 8 The one who made the Pleiades and Orion,
\q2 who brings dawn just when it's darkest,
\q1 and turns the daylight back into nighttime,
\q2 who summons the ocean’s waters,
\q1 and pours them out over dry land,
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* is his name.
\v 9 Who makes disaster ambush the mighty,
\q2 sends disaster as far as their hideout.
\v 10 Oh, you who hate anyone correcting you in public,
\q2 and avoid anyone who speaks frankly,
\v 11 because you've marginalized the weak,
\q2 and demanded a share of their crops!
\q1 Well, you have built tiled houses,
\q2 but you will not call them home.
\q1 You have planted lush vineyards,
\q2 But you will not drink their wine.
\v 12 Oh, I know your long list of [cth:licence|us:license], 
\q2 your staggering count of sins!
\q1 You adversaries of the innocent!
\q2 Your hands out for hush money,
\q1 While you drive away the needy downtown\f + \fq downtown \fl Lit. \fqa in the gates.\f*! 
\q2 \v 13 That's why a person with any sense
\q1 will keep their mouth shut at a time like this.
\q2 These are troubled times.
\v 14 So work toward good, and stay out of trouble,
\q2 You want to live. So be it!
\q1 Yes, the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Armies,
\q2 be with you, as you have said.
\v 15 Hate trouble, and love good,
\q2 and make justice a fixture downtown.
\q1 Who knows? Maybe the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Armies,
\q2 will be sympathetic to what’s left of Joseph.
\b 
\v 16 So this is what the \nd Lord\nd* says,
\q2 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor], the God of Armies.
\q1 "There will be mourning on every boulevard,
\q2 and in every street they’ll cry, 'No, no!'
\q1 They’ll call in the gravedigger to the burial,
\q2 and the funeral directors for the memorial,
\v 17 There’ll be a funeral in every farmyard,
\q2 when I come through to deal with you," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b 
\v 18 "Beware, you that are wishing for the Day of the \nd Lord\nd*!
\q2 What business of yours is the Day of the \nd Lord\nd*?
\q1 It's darkness, and not light.
\q2 \v 19 It's like when a person runs away from a lion,
\q1 and a bear meets them,
\q2 Or they go in the house, and lean a hand on the wall,
\q1 and a snake bites them.
\q2 \v 20 Won’t it be dark on the Day of the \nd Lord\nd*, and not bright?
\q1 Amd be black, without a ray of light?
\q2 \v 21 I hate, I'm disgusted by your holidays.
\q1 And I do not want to smell your barbecues.
\q2 \v 22 No, if you offer burnt offerings,
\q1 and grain offerings, I won’t enjoy them.
\q2 I won’t give your marbled meat a second look.
\v 23 Get the noise of your songs away from me.
\q2 I am through listening to the plunking of your strings.
\v 24 Just let fairness roll in like ocean waves,
\q2 and ethics like a year-round stream.
\v 25 Did you bring me sacrifices and grain offerings
\q2 in the wilderness forty years, family of Israel?
\v 26 No, you carried the shelters of your kings,
\q2 and the standard of your images,
\q1 the star of your gods, that you made for yourselves.
\q2 \v 27 And I will deport you beyond Damascus."
\q1 That is what the \nd Lord\nd* has said,
\q2 whose name is the God of Armies.
\b  
\v 6
\v 1 Watch out, you who are at your ease in Zion,
\q2 and self-assured in Samaria Hill!
\q1 You're driven men, an international elite, 
\q2 And the family of Israel comes to you.
\v 2 Travel to Calneh and see,
\q2 and go from there to Greater Hamath.
\q1 Then out to Philistine Gath. Are your kingdoms better than theirs?
\q2 Or is the area inside your borders bigger?
\v 3 Are you holding off times of hardship?
\q2 And how? At the price of harsh tyranny?
\v 4 You are lying on ivory beds,
\q2 and relaxing on your couches, 
\q1 and eating milk-fed lamb and penned veal.

\q1 and put on lotions of virgin oil,\f + \fq virgin oil \ft Oil from Tekoa was traditionally preferred for Temple use, because of its quality.\f*
\q2 but you are not at all concerned about the decline of Joseph. 
\v 7 So now you'll be the first in line to be deported, 
\q2 and the cheers of the party-goers will fade away.
\v 8 His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* has sworn by himself. 
\q2 The \nd Lord\nd*,  the God of Armies, announces,
\q1 "I want nothing to do with the Rise of Jacob!\f + \fq Rise of Jacob \fl Traditionally, \fqa Pride of Jacob.\f*

\q2 \v 9 For example, if there are ten men

\q2 \v 10 And there will be someone taking the corpse

\q2 And he will ask someone he meets in an alley,
\q1 “Is anyone left?”
\q2 And he will answer, “Not a one,” and then, “Hush!
\q1 We mustn’t be heard speaking the name of the \nd Lord\nd*!”
\q2 \v 11 Because, you see, the \nd Lord\nd* will give the order
\q1 to shatter the great house to bits,
\q2 and to split the small house into pieces.
\v 12 Can horses run over steep rocks?
\q2 Can they be plowed with oxen?
\q1 Because you’ve turned right judgment over to opium,
\q2 and the fruit of right practice to [cth:wormwood|us:sagebrush].

\q1 when the grass from the spring rains sprouted.
\q2 Now, this was the growth flush after the King’s Cutting.
\v 2 And when they were about
\q2 to finish off the vegetation of the land,
\q1 Then I said, Your [cth:Honour|us:Honor], \nd Lord\nd*! Please, stop!
\q2 How can Jacob survive? He is so small!
\v 3 The \nd Lord\nd* was moved by the thought.
\q2 “That will not happen,” the \nd Lord\nd* said.

\q2 and it had begun to devour the farmland.
\v 5 Then I said, Your [cth:Honour|us:Honor], \nd Lord\nd*! Stop, please!,

\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* was moved by the thought.
\q2 “That will not happen, either,” His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* said.

\q2 and he had a plumbline in his hand.
\v 8 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me,
\q2 "What do you see, Amos?"
\q1 And I answered, “A plumbline.”
\q2 Then His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* said,
\q1 “It’s because I’m going to hold a plumbline
\q2 up against my people Israel,
\q1 I am not going to spare them any more.

\q1 The temples of Israel will be desolate,
\q2 and I will attack the House of Jeroboam with the sword.”
\b 
\v 10 Then Amaziah the priest of Beit El
\q2 sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel that said,
\q1 “Amos has formed a conspiracy against you among the House of Israel.
\q2 The country is not secure while he is allowed to speak.
\v 11 Because Amos has said that ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword,
\q2 and Israel is going to be deported away from their own soil.'”
\b 
\v 12 Then Amaziah said to Amos, "You holy man!\f + \fq holy man \fl Lit. \fqa seer. \fl cf. \ft 1 Samuel 9.9. Amaziah insults Amos by using the archaic term for a prophet.\f* Go, run back home to Judah!

\v 14 Then Amos answered Amaziah, and said,

\q1 But I was a cowhand, and I scored sycomore figs for ripening.
\q2 \v 15 Then the \nd Lord\nd* took me from the cattle trail,
\q1 and the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, ‘Go, and speak out to my people Israel.’
\q2 \v 16 So, now, listen to the word of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q1 You're saying, ‘Don't speak out against Israel,
\q2 or criticize the House of Ithaac.’
\v 17  Well, that's why the \nd Lord\nd* says this:
\q2 'Your wife is going to end up as a prostitute in the big city. 
\q1 Your sons and your daughters are going to fall by the sword.
\q2 Your farm is going to be surveyed and subdivided. 
\q1 And you yourself are going to die where the land is unclean,

\q2 \v 7 The \nd Lord\nd* swears, “By the Rise of Jacob!
\q1 See if I ever forget all they have done!”
\q2 \v 8 Isn’t that why the earth is in uproar,
\q1 And all its population is in despair?
\q2 That's why the sea level rises like a spring flood,\f + \fq like a spring flood \fl Others \fqa like the Nile. \ft The word \tr 'or\tr*, used only here, is probably a common noun related to \tr Y'or\tr*, "Nile."\f*
\q1 And overflows, and spreads out,
\q2 And finds a new shore,\f + \fq finds a new shore \fl Traditionally emended as \fqa subsides \ft to match 9.5e. The emendation, from a common water-word to a less common one, seems unnecessary. \f* like the Nile in Egypt.
\b 
\v 9 "And it will also happen at that time,"
\q2 declares His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q1 "That I will bring in the sun at noon
\q2 And darken the land on a clear day.
\v 10 And I will turn your holidays into mourning,
\q2 And all your songs into wailing.
\q1 I will have everyone wearing black,
\q2 And every head shaved.
\q1 I will make it like the mourning for an only child,
\q2 And what follows like a day for embalming.\f + \fq a day for embalming \fl Traditionally \fqa a bitter day. \ft Repointing gives \tr yom mor\tr*, "a day for myrrh" instead of \tr mar\tr*, "a bitter day."\f*
\v 11 "You see, times are coming,"
\q2 declares His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q1 "When I will send a famine on the land.
\q2 Not a food famine or a water shortage,
\q1 But one for hearing the word of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q2 \v 12 Then they will flit from sea to sea,
\q1 And from the north to the sunrise, they will flog themselves
\q2 in search of the word of the \nd Lord\nd*, but they won't find it.
\v 13 In that day the beautiful girls
\q2 And the eligible young men are going to faint from thirst,
\v 14 The ones who swear by the Guilt Sacrifice of Samaria,
\q2 and say, 'Your God lives, Dan!’
\q1 And, ‘Long live the Way of Beersheba!'
\q2 Yes, they will fall, and not get up again."
\b 
\c 9  
\v 1 I saw the \nd Lord\nd* standing next to the altar,
\q2 and he said, “Hit the capital, and make the thresholds shake!
\q1 Yes, break them all off at the top!
\q2 And I’ll kill the ones left with the sword.
\q1 Not a one will bolt and get away.
\q2 And none of the stragglers will escape.
\v 2 If they burrow down to Sheol,
\q2 I’ll reach in and pull them out.
\q1 And if they soar up into the sky,
\q2 I will bring them right down to ground.
\v 3 If they hide out on the top of Carmel,
\q2 I’ll come in quietly and round them up there.
\q1 And if they hide where I can't see them on the bottom of the ocean,
\q2 I’ll just send in a deep-sea eel to bite them.
\v 4 And if they try to return home in spite of their enemies,
\q2 I will send to have them killed with the sword.
\q1 I will keep my eye on them, all right.
\q2 I mean that in a bad way, not in a good way."
\v 5 And His [cth:Honour|us:Honor], the \nd Lord\nd* of Armies,
\q2 who touches the earth and it melts,
\q1 and all of its population panics,
\q2 and the sea level rises like a river in flood,
\q1 and crests, like the Nile in Egypt,
\q2 \v 6 who builds up water towers in the sky,
\q1 and has set up its reservoirs on earth,
\q2 who summons the waters of the ocean,
\q1 and pours them out on dry land;
\q2 the \nd Lord\nd* is his name.
\v 7 “Aren’t you just like the people of the Cushites to me,
\q2 people of Israel?” says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q1 “Didn’t I bring Israel up out of the land of Egypt?
\q2 And the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?
\v 8 See, now. His [cth:Honour|us:Honor] the \nd Lord\nd* has his eye on this crooked country,
\q2 And he would have wiped you off the face of the earth,
\q1 if it wasn’t that he will never make a full end
\q2 Of the family of Jacob," says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 9 "Because, you see, I am going to give the order,
\q2 and the family of Israel will be sifted among all the nations,
\q1 like sifting through a grain sieve.
\q2 And not one pebble will fall to the ground.
\v 10 Through the sword all the evildoers among my people will die.
\q2 The ones who say, “Trouble won’t touch us. It’s not coming our way.”
\v 11 At that time I will put up again
\q2 David’s shelter that has fallen down.
\q1 And I will patch the holes in the the wall,
\q2 and I'll rebuild what’s been torn apart,
\q1 and I will build it again the way it was a long time ago.
\q2 \v 12 So they may take possession of what’s left of Edom,
\q1 and all the nations that have had my name called over them,”
\q2 declares the \nd Lord\nd*, who does all this.
\b 
\v 13 "A time is coming, you see,"
\q2 declares the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q1 "when the plowman will be interrupted\f + \fq will be interrupted \fl Others \fqa will overtake. \fl Lit. \fqa will meet.\f* by the reaper,
\q2 and the grape treader by the one bringing out the seed.
\q1 And the mountains will foam over with fresh wine,
\q2 and all of the hills will re-soften.
\v 14 And I will bring back the returnees of my people Israel,
\q2 and they will rebuild the ruined cities and live there,
\q1 and plant vineyards and drink their wine,
\q2 and plant orchards and eat their fruit.
\v 15 And I will plant them on their land,
\q2 and they will never again be uprooted from their own soil,
\q1 which I gave to them,"
\q2 says the \nd Lord\nd* your God.
